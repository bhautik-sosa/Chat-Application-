# Real-Time Chat Application

Welcome to the Real-Time Chat Application! This project enables two users to send messages to each other in real-time using a simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java Swing and TCP socket programming.

# OverView :-
This Real-Time Chat Application is designed to facilitate direct communication between two users over a network. By leveraging Java Swing for the GUI and TCP socket programming for network communication, the application ensures that messages are transmitted instantly and reliably between clients. This project serves as an excellent example of how to implement real-time communication in Java and can be a great learning resource for those interested in network programming and GUI development.

Key aspects of the application include:
- **Client-Server Architecture**: The server handles multiple client connections, facilitating the exchange of messages between clients.
- **Simple GUI**: The interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for users to connect and start chatting.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Messages sent by one user appear instantly on the other user's chat window, ensuring a seamless communication experience.

Whether you are a beginner looking to understand the basics of network programming or an experienced developer seeking to expand your knowledge of Java Swing and socket programming, this project provides a solid foundation.
